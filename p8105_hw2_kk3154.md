## Problem 1 - Mr. Trash Wheel data

1.1 - Reading and cleaning the Mr. Trash Wheel excel data sheet: \*
omitting non-data entries \* using reasonable variable names \* omitting
rows with non-dumpster specific data \* round number of sports balls to
the nearest integer \* NA’ing the date for one observation in January
2020 with date ‘1900-01-20’

``` r
trash_df = read_excel(
  "data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-7-2020-2.xlsx",
  sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel", 
  range = "A2:N535") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(dumpster, month) %>% 
  mutate(sports_balls = round(sports_balls))
```

1.2 - Reading and cleaning precipitation data: \* years: 2018-2019 \*
omit rows without precip data \* add variable for year

``` r
precip_18 = read_excel(
  "data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-7-2020-2.xlsx",
  sheet = "2018 Precipitation",
  skip = 1) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(month) %>% 
  mutate(year = 2018)

precip_19 = read_excel(
  "data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-7-2020-2.xlsx",
  sheet = "2019 Precipitation",
  skip = 1) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(month) %>% 
  mutate(year = 2019)
```

-   combine precipitation datasets
-   convert month to a character variable

``` r
precip_df = 
  bind_rows(precip_18, precip_19) %>% 
  rename(precip_tot = total) %>% 
  mutate(month = month.name[month])
```

The Mr. Trash Wheel dataset contains 14 variables of data on how much
trash of various types (plastic bottles, cigarette butts, grocery bags,
etc.) by weight and volume was collected by the Trash Wheel in
Baltimore’s Inner Harbor. Data are collected and reported each time a
dumpster is filled, and there were 453 dumpster observation rows
recorded in this dataset between 2014 and 2021. The amount of trash can
be impacted by rainfall. The precipitation dataset contains
precipitation totals in Baltimore (in inches) by month, with a total of
3 variables in the dataset and 24 observations between 2018 and 2019.
The total precipitation in 2018 was 70.33 inches. The median number of
sports balls in a dumpster in 2019 was 9 balls.
